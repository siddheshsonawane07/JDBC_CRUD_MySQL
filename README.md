Java Database Connectivity CRUD operations in MySQL

JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity. JDBC is a Java API to connect and execute the query with the database. It is a part of JavaSE (Java Standard Edition). JDBC API uses JDBC drivers to connect with the database. There are four types of JDBC drivers:

1. JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver
2. Native Driver
3. Network Protocol Driver
4. Thin Driver

We can use JDBC API to access tabular data stored in any relational database. By the help of JDBC API, we can save, update, delete and fetch data from the database.
The java.sql package contains classes and interfaces for JDBC API.
